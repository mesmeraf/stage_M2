abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a soil bacterium that effectively colonises the roots of many plants and degrades a variety of toxic aromatic compounds. Its genome has recently been sequenced. We describe that a 35 bp sequence with the structure of an imperfect palindrome, originally found repeated three times downstream of the rpoH gene terminator, is detected more than 800 times in the chromosome of this strain. The structure of this DNA segment is analogous to that of the so-called enterobacteriaceae repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences, although its sequence is different. Computer-assisted analysis of the presence and distribution of this repeated sequence in the P.putida chromosome revealed that in at least 80\% of the cases the sequence is extragenic, and in 82\% of the cases the distance of this extragenic element to the end of one of the neighbouring genes was <100 bp. This 35 bp element can be found either as a single element, as pairs of elements, or sometimes forming clusters of up to five elements in which they alternate orientation. PCR scanning of chromosomes from different isolates of Pseudomonas sp. strains using oligonucleotides complementary to the most conserved region of this sequence shows that it is only present in isolates of the species P.putida. For this reason we suggest that the P.putida 35 bp element is a distinctive REP sequence in P.putida. This is the first time that REP sequences have been described and characterised in a group of non-enterobacteriaceae.},

We report here that Escherichia coli PU sequences contain three motifs (Y, Z1 and Z2), leading to the definition of two BIME families. The BIME-1 family, highly conserved over 145 nucleotides, contains two PUs (motifs Y and Z1). The BIME-2 family contains a variable number of PUs (motifs Y and Z2). We present evidence, using band shift experiments, that each PU motif binds DNA gyrase with a different affinity. This suggests that the two families are functionally distinct.},

abstract = {Bacterial transcripts each have a characteristic half-life, suggesting that the processes of RNA degradation work in an active and selective manner. Moreover, the processes are well controlled, thereby ensuring that degradation is orderly and coordinated. Throughout much of the bacterial kingdom, RNA degradation processes originate through the actions of assemblies of key RNA enzymes, known as RNA degradosomes. Neither conserved in composition, nor unified by common evolutionary ancestry, RNA degradosomes nonetheless can be found in divergent bacterial lineages, implicating a common requirement for the co-localisation of RNA metabolic activities. We describe how the cooperation of components in the representative degradosome of Escherichia coli may enable controlled access to transcripts, so that they have defined and programmable lifetimes. We also discuss how this cooperation contributes to precursor processing and to the riboregulation of intricate post-transcriptional networks in the control of gene expression. The E. coli degradosome interacts with the cytoplasmic membrane, and we discuss how this interaction may spatially organise the assembly and contribute to subunit cooperation and substrate capture.

abstract = {Repetitive sequences are a conserved feature of many bacterial genomes. While first reported almost thirty years ago, and frequently exploited for genotyping purposes, little is known about their origin, maintenance, or processes affecting the dynamics of within-genome evolution. Here, beginning with analysis of the diversity and abundance of short oligonucleotide sequences in the genome of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, we show that over-represented short sequences define three distinct groups (GI, GII, and GIII) of repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences. Patterns of REP distribution suggest that closely linked REP sequences form a functional replicative unit: REP doublets are over-represented, randomly distributed in extragenic space, and more highly conserved than singlets. In addition, doublets are organized as inverted repeats, which together with intervening spacer sequences are predicted to form hairpin structures in ssDNA or mRNA. We refer to these newly defined entities as REPINs (REP doublets forming hairpins) and identify short reads from population sequencing that reveal putative transposition intermediates. The proximal relationship between GI, GII, and GIII REPINs and specific REP-associated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs), combined with features of the putative transposition intermediate, suggests a mechanism for within-genome dissemination. Analysis of the distribution of REPs in a range of RAYT-containing bacterial genomes, including Escherichia coli K-12 and Nostoc punctiforme, show that REPINs are a widely distributed, but hitherto unrecognized, family of miniature non-autonomous mobile DNA.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli endoribonuclease E has a major influence on gene expression. It is essential for the maturation of ribosomal and transfer RNA as well as the rapid degradation of messenger RNA. The latter ensures that translation closely follows programming at the level of transcription. Recently, one of the hallmarks of RNase E, i.e. its ability to bind via a 5'-monophosphorylated end, was shown to be unnecessary for the initial cleavage of some polycistronic tRNA precursors. Here we show using RNA-seq analyses of ribonuclease-deficient strains in vivo and a 5'-sensor mutant of RNase E in vitro that, contrary to current models, 5'-monophosphate-independent, 'direct entry' cleavage is a major pathway for degrading and processing RNA. Moreover, we present further evidence that direct entry is facilitated by RNase E binding simultaneously to multiple unpaired regions. These simple requirements may maximize the rate of degradation and processing by permitting multiple sites to be surveyed directly without being constrained by 5'-end tethering. Cleavage was detected at a multitude of sites previously undescribed for RNase E, including ones that regulate the activity and specificity of ribosomes. A potentially broad role for RNase G, an RNase E paralogue, in the trimming of 5'-monophosphorylated ends was also revealed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: REPs (Repetitive Extragenic Palindromes) are small (20-40 bp) palindromic repeats found in high copies in some prokaryotic genomes, hypothesized to play a role in DNA supercoiling, transcription termination, mRNA stabilization.

RESULTS: We have monitored a large number of REP elements in prokaryotic genomes, and found that most can be sorted into two large DNA super-families, as they feature at one end unpaired motifs fitting either the GTAG or the CGTC consensus. Tagged REPs have been identified in >80 species in 8 different phyla. GTAG and CGTC repeats reside predominantly in microorganisms of the gamma and alpha division of Proteobacteria, respectively. However, the identification of members of both super- families in deeper branching phyla such Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes supports the notion that REPs are old components of the bacterial chromosome. On the basis of sequence content and overall structure, GTAG and CGTC repeats have been assigned to 24 and 4 families, respectively. Of these, some are species-specific, others reside in multiple species, and several organisms contain different REP types. In many families, most units are close to each other in opposite orientation, and may potentially fold into larger secondary structures. In different REP-rich genomes the repeats are predominantly located between unidirectionally and convergently transcribed ORFs. REPs are predominantly located downstream from coding regions, and many are plausibly transcribed and function as RNA elements. REPs located inside genes have been identified in several species. Many lie within replication and global genome repair genes. It has been hypothesized that GTAG REPs are miniature transposons mobilized by specific transposases known as RAYTs (REP associated tyrosine transposases). RAYT genes are flanked either by GTAG repeats or by long terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) unrelated to GTAG repeats. Moderately abundant families of TIRs have been identified in multiple species.

CONCLUSIONS: CGTC REPs apparently lack a dedicated transposase. Future work will clarify whether these elements may be mobilized by RAYTs or other transposases, and assess if de-novo formation of either GTAG or CGTC repeats type still occurs.},

However, the volume and output of data produced by these technologies present challenges in analysis. Here, a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is implemented and tailored to handle multiple genomic profile, to better facilitate genome annotation by assisting in the detection of transcripts, regulatory regions, and copy number variation by holistic microarray or NGS. With support for various data distributions, instead of limiting itself to one specific application, the proposed hidden semi-Markov model is designed to allow modeling options to accommodate different types of genomic data and to serve as a general segmentation engine. By incorporating genomic positions into the sojourn distribution of HSMM, with optional prior learning using annotation or previous studies, the modeling output is more biologically sensible. The proposed model has been compared with several other state-of-the-art segmentation models through simulation benchmarking, which shows that our efficient implementation achieves comparable or better sensitivity and specificity in genomic segmentation.},

abstract = {Transcription attenuation comprises several processes that affect transcript elongation and transcription termination, and has an important role in regulating gene expression. In most cases, transcription attenuation is used as a regulatory mechanism that allows the cell to adjust protein synthesis levels in response to a specific signal. Here, by using a tRNA gene as a transcriptional reporter, we characterize a new type of transcription attenuation mechanism in Escherichia coli that involves bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIMEs), the main family of repetitive extragenic elements. The transcription termination factor Rho is required for attenuation in association with BIMEs, thus revealing a new role for Rho as a BIMEs-dependent global regulator of gene expression. By mutational analyses, we identified nucleotide determinants of BIMEs that are required for attenuation and showed that this process relies on a sequence-specific mechanism. Our data are consistent with a model in which BIMEs provoke a pause in RNA polymerase movement and Rho acts ultimately to terminate transcription. BIME-dependent transcription attenuation may be used as a means to differentially regulate expression of adjacent genes belonging to a single operon. BIMEs are dispersed in more than 250 operons such that attenuation can simultaneously affect expression of a large number of genes encoding unrelated proteins. This attenuation phenomenon, together with the known ability of BIMEs to stabilize upstream mRNA, reveals how dispersion of these abundant repetitive elements may affect gene regulation at the genome level.},

abstract = {Microorganisms extensively reorganize gene expression to adjust growth rate to changes in growth conditions. At the genomic scale, we measured the contribution of both transcription and transcript stability to regulating messenger RNA (mRNA) concentration in Escherichia coli. Transcriptional control was the dominant regulatory process. Between growth rates of 0.10 and 0.63 h(-1), there was a generic increase in the bulk mRNA transcription. However, many transcripts became less stable and the median mRNA half-life decreased from 4.2 to 2.8 min. This is the first evidence that mRNA turnover is slower at extremely low-growth rates. The destabilization of many, but not all, transcripts at high-growth rate correlated with transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding the mRNA degradation machinery. We identified five classes of growth-rate regulation ranging from mainly transcriptional to mainly degradational. In general, differential stability within polycistronic messages encoded by operons does not appear to be affected by growth rate. We show here that the substantial reorganization of gene expression involving downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle genes and acetyl-CoA synthetase at high-growth rates is controlled mainly by transcript stability. Overall, our results demonstrate that the control of transcript stability has an important role in fine-tuning mRNA concentration during changes in growth rate.},

By sorting the DNA sequences of the known PU containing regions into different classes, we show here for the first time that, besides the PU themselves, each PU clusters contains a number of other conserved sequence motifs. Seven such motifs were identified with the present list of PU regions. Remarkably, each PU cluster is exclusively composed of a mosaic combination of PU and of these other sequence motifs. We demonstrate directly by hybridization experiments that one of these motifs (called L) is indeed present at a large number of copies on the Escherichia coli chromosome and that its distribution follows the same species specificity as PU sequences themselves. We propose that the mosaic pattern of motif combination in PU clusters reveals a new type of bacterial genetic element which we propose to call BIME for Bacterial Interspersed Mosaic Element.

abstract = {The nucleotide sequences of the intercistronic regions from several multicistronic operons have recently been determined. In many cases such intercistronic regions consist of only a few base pairs (bp); in certain extreme cases, where the initiation codon of one gene overlaps the termination codon of the previous gene, intercistronic regions are essentially absent. However, in other cases intercistronic regions can be up to several hundred base pairs long; it seems reasonable to suppose that, at least in these cases, such regions have a role in regulation expression of the operon. Indeed, a regulatory function for the large intercistronic region of the rplJL-rpoBC operon has been demonstrated. We have now identified a genetic element, common to intercistronic regions from three independent bacterial operons (the histidine transport and the histidine biosynthetic operons of Salmonella typhimurium and the malK-lamB operon of the malB region of Escherichia coli), which we believe to be important in regulating the differential expression of individual genes in the multicistronic operons. A similar element is also found immediately following the trpR gene of E. coli although in this case it is not known whether or not a distal gene exists. Each of these elements consists of a long dyad symmetry which, once transcribed, could form an exceptionally stable stem-loop structure with a stem of up to 35 bp. In each case smaller palindromic units are also found, some of which overlap the main symmetry. The stem-loop structures show remarkable homology (...90\%) and probably have a common evolutionary origin, possibly an insertion element. It seems that the function of these structures is to effect a decrease in expression of the distal genes in an operon.},

In a number of operons, mRNA stabilization by REP sequences plays an important role in the control of gene expression. Furthermore, differential mRNA stability mediated by the REP sequences can be responsible for differential gene expression within polycistronic operons. Despite the key role of REP sequences in mRNA stability and gene expression in a number of operons, several lines of evidence suggest that this is unlikely to be the primary reason for the exceptionally high degree of sequence conservation between REP sequences. Other possible functions for REP sequences are discussed. We propose that REP sequences may be a prokaryotic equivalent of ‘selfish DNA’ and that gene conversion may play a role in the evolution and maintenance of REP sequences.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli, REP-stabilizers are structural elements in polycistronic messages that protect 5'-proximal cistrons from 3'-->5' exonucleolytic degradation. The stabilization of a protected cistron can be an important determinant in the level of gene expression. Our results suggest that RNase E, an endoribonuclease, initiates the degradation of REP-stabilized mRNA. However, subsequent degradation of mRNA fragments containing a REP-stabilizer poses a special challenge to the mRNA degradation machinery. Two enzymes, the DEAD-box RNA helicase, RhlB and poly(A) polymerase (PAP) are required to facilitate the degradation of REP-stabilizers by polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). This is the first in vivo evidence that these enzymes are required for the degradation of REP-stabilizers. Furthermore, our results show that REP degradation by RhlB and PNPase requires their association with RNase E as components of the RNA degradosome, thus providing the first in vivo evidence that this ribonucleolytic multienzyme complex is involved in the degradation of structured mRNA fragments.},

abstract = {Recent advances in prokaryote genetics have highlighted the important and complex roles of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Although blocking mRNA translation is often the main function of sRNAs, these molecules can also induce the degradation of target mRNAs using a mechanism that drastically differs from eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi). Whereas RNAi relies on RNase III-like machinery that is specific to double-strand RNAs, sRNA-mediated mRNA degradation in Escherichia coli and Samonella typhimurium depends on RNase E, a single-strand specific endoribonuclease. Surprisingly, the latest descriptions of sRNA-mediated mRNA degradation in various bacteria suggest a variety of previously unsuspected mechanisms. In this review, we focus on recently characterized mechanisms in which sRNAs can bind to target mRNAs to induce decay. These new mechanisms illustrate how sRNAs and mRNA structures, including riboswitches, act cooperatively with protein partners to initiate the decay of mRNAs. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: RNA Decay mechanisms. © 2013.},

abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) have enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes. However, computational methods for analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have not kept pace with the large and growing data sets generated by RNA-seq technology. Here, we present new algorithms, specific to bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of RNA-seq data. The algorithms are implemented in an open source software system called Rockhopper that supports various stages of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, including aligning sequencing reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing results. We demonstrate the performance of Rockhopper using 2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 RNA-seq experiments conducted with Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes and Xenorhabdus nematophila. We find that the transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system's ability to identify novel small RNAs, operons and transcription start sites. Our results suggest that Rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial RNA-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.},

abstract = {Extragenic sequences in genomes, such as microRNA and CRISPR, are vital players in the cell. Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences (REPs) are a class of extragenic sequences, which form nucleotide stem-loop structures. REPs are found in many bacterial species at a high copy number and are important in regulation of certain bacterial functions, such as Integration Host Factor recruitment and mRNA turnover. Although a new clade of putative transposases (RAYTs or TnpA(REP)) is often associated with an increase in these repeats, it is not clear how these proteins might have directed amplification of REPs. We report here the structure to 2.6 \AA of TnpA(REP) from Escherichia coli MG1655 bound to a REP. Sequence analysis showed that TnpA(REP) is highly related to the IS200/IS605 family, but in contrast to IS200/IS605 transposases, TnpA(REP) is a monomer, is auto-inhibited and is active only in manganese. These features suggest that, relative to IS200/IS605 transposases, it has evolved a different mechanism for the movement of discrete segments of DNA and has been severely down-regulated, perhaps to prevent REPs from sweeping through genomes.},

abstract = {Tiling microarrays have proven to be a valuable tool for gaining insights into the transcriptomes of microbial organisms grown under various nutritional or stress conditions. Here, we describe the use of such an array, constructed at the level of 20 nt resolution for the Escherichia coli MG1655 genome, to observe genome-wide changes in the steady-state RNA levels in mutants defective in either RNase E or RNase III. The array data were validated by comparison to previously published results for a variety of specific transcripts as well as independent northern analysis of additional mRNAs and sRNAs. In the absence of RNase E, 60\% of the annotated coding sequences showed either increases or decreases in their steady-state levels. In contrast, only 12\% of the coding sequences were affected in the absence of RNase III. Unexpectedly, many coding sequences showed decreased abundance in the RNase E mutant, while more than half of the annotated sRNAs showed changes in abundance. Furthermore, the steady-state levels of many transcripts showed overlapping effects of both ribonucleases. Data are also presented demonstrating how the arrays were used to identify potential new genes, RNase III cleavage sites and the direct or indirect control of specific biological pathways.},

@article{Tobes2005,
abstract = {Repetitive extragenic palindromic (REPs) sequences were first described in enterobacteriacea and later in Pseudomonas putida. We have detected a new variant (51 base pairs) of REP sequences that appears to be disseminated in more than 300 copies in the Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 genome. The finding of REP sequences in P. syringae confirms the broad presence of this type of repetitive sequence in bacteria. We analyzed the distribution of REP sequences and the structure of the clusters, and we show that palindromy is conserved. REP sequences appear to be allocated to the extragenic space, with a special preference for the intergenic spaces limited by convergent genes, while their presence is scarce between divergent genes. Using REP sequences as markers of extragenicity we re-annotated a set of genes of the P. syringae DC3000 genome demonstrating that REP sequences can be used for refinement of annotation of a genome. The similarity detected between virulence genes from evolutionarily distant pathogenic bacteria suggests the acquisition of clusters of virulence genes by horizontal gene transfer. We did not detect the presence of P. syringae REP elements in the principal pathogenicity gene clusters. This absence suggests that genome fragments lacking REP sequences could point to regions recently acquired from other organisms, and REP sequences might be new tracers for gaining insight into key aspects of bacterial genome evolution, especially when studying pathogenicity acquisition. In addition, as the P. syringae REP sequence is species-specific with respect to the sequenced genomes, it is an exceptional candidate for use as a fingerprint in precise genotyping and epidemiological studies.},

@article{Ton-Hoang2012,
abstract = {REPs are highly repeated intergenic palindromic sequences often clustered into structures called BIMEs including two individual REPs separated by short linker of variable length. They play a variety of key roles in the cell. REPs also resemble the sub-terminal hairpins of the atypical IS200/605 family of insertion sequences which encode Y1 transposases (TnpA(IS200/IS605)). These belong to the HUH endonuclease family, carry a single catalytic tyrosine (Y) and promote single strand transposition. Recently, a new clade of Y1 transposases (TnpA(REP)) was found associated with REP/BIME in structures called REPtrons. It has been suggested that TnpA(REP) is responsible for REP/BIME proliferation over genomes. We analysed and compared REP distribution and REPtron structure in numerous available E. coli and Shigella strains. Phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated that tnpA(REP) was acquired early in the species radiation and was lost later in some strains. To understand REP/BIME behaviour within the host genome, we also studied E. coli K12 TnpA(REP) activity in vitro and demonstrated that it catalyses cleavage and recombination of BIMEs. While TnpA(REP) shared the same general organization and similar catalytic characteristics with TnpA(IS200/IS605) transposases, it exhibited distinct properties potentially important in the creation of BIME variability and in their amplification. TnpA(REP) may therefore be one of the first examples of transposase domestication in prokaryotes.},
