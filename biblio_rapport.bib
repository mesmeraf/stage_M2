abstract = {The pst operon of Escherichia coli is composed of five genes that encode a high-affinity phosphate transport system. As a member of the PHO regulon, pst transcription is activated under phosphate shortage conditions. Under phosphate-replete conditions, the pst operon also functions as a negative regulator of the PHO genes. Transcription of pst is initiated at the promoter located upstream to the first gene, pstS. Immediately after its synthesis, the primary transcript of pst is cleaved into shorter mRNA molecules. The transcription unit corresponding to pstS is significantly more abundant than the transcripts of the other pst genes due to stabilisation of pstS mRNA by a repetitive extragenic palindrome (REP) structure downstream to the pstS locus. The presence of the REP sequence also results in an increased level of PstS proteins. However, the surplus level of PstS proteins produced in the presence of REP does not contribute to the repressive role of Pst in PHO expression.},

abstract = {RNA-seq is a powerful tool for the study of alternative splicing and other forms of alternative isoform expression. Understanding the regulation of these processes requires sensitive and specific detection of differential isoform abundance in comparisons between conditions, cell types, or tissues. We present DEXSeq, a statistical method to test for differential exon usage in RNA-seq data. DEXSeq uses generalized linear models and offers reliable control of false discoveries by taking biological variation into account. DEXSeq detects with high sensitivity genes, and in many cases exons, that are subject to differential exon usage. We demonstrate the versatility of DEXSeq by applying it to several data sets. The method facilitates the study of regulation and function of alternative exon usage on a genome-wide scale. An implementation of DEXSeq is available as an R/Bioconductor package.},

abstract = {Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is a soil bacterium that effectively colonises the roots of many plants and degrades a variety of toxic aromatic compounds. Its genome has recently been sequenced. We describe that a 35 bp sequence with the structure of an imperfect palindrome, originally found repeated three times downstream of the rpoH gene terminator, is detected more than 800 times in the chromosome of this strain. The structure of this DNA segment is analogous to that of the so-called enterobacteriaceae repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences, although its sequence is different. Computer-assisted analysis of the presence and distribution of this repeated sequence in the P.putida chromosome revealed that in at least 80\% of the cases the sequence is extragenic, and in 82\% of the cases the distance of this extragenic element to the end of one of the neighbouring genes was <100 bp. This 35 bp element can be found either as a single element, as pairs of elements, or sometimes forming clusters of up to five elements in which they alternate orientation. PCR scanning of chromosomes from different isolates of Pseudomonas sp. strains using oligonucleotides complementary to the most conserved region of this sequence shows that it is only present in isolates of the species P.putida. For this reason we suggest that the P.putida 35 bp element is a distinctive REP sequence in P.putida. This is the first time that REP sequences have been described and characterised in a group of non-enterobacteriaceae.},

abstract = {A significant fraction of Escherichia coli intergenic DNA sequences is composed of two families of repeated bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIME-1 and BIME-2). In this study, we determined the sequence organization of six intergenic regions in 51 E. coli and Shigella natural isolates. Each region contains a BIME in E. coli K-12. We found that multiple sequence variations are located within or near these BIMEs in the different bacteria. Events included excisions of a whole BIME-1, expansion/deletion within a BIME-2 and insertions of non-BIME sequences like the boxC repeat or a new IS element, named IS 1397. Remarkably, 14 out of IS 1397 integration sites correspond to a BIME sequence, strongly suggesting that this IS element is specifically associated with BIMEs, and thus inserts only in extragenic regions. Unlike BIMEs, IS 1397 is not detected in all E. coli isolates. Possible relationships between the presence of this IS element and the evolution of BIMEs are discussed.},

We report here that Escherichia coli PU sequences contain three motifs (Y, Z1 and Z2), leading to the definition of two BIME families. The BIME-1 family, highly conserved over 145 nucleotides, contains two PUs (motifs Y and Z1). The BIME-2 family contains a variable number of PUs (motifs Y and Z2). We present evidence, using band shift experiments, that each PU motif binds DNA gyrase with a different affinity. This suggests that the two families are functionally distinct.},

abstract = {Bacterial transcripts each have a characteristic half-life, suggesting that the processes of RNA degradation work in an active and selective manner. Moreover, the processes are well controlled, thereby ensuring that degradation is orderly and coordinated. Throughout much of the bacterial kingdom, RNA degradation processes originate through the actions of assemblies of key RNA enzymes, known as RNA degradosomes. Neither conserved in composition, nor unified by common evolutionary ancestry, RNA degradosomes nonetheless can be found in divergent bacterial lineages, implicating a common requirement for the co-localisation of RNA metabolic activities. We describe how the cooperation of components in the representative degradosome of Escherichia coli may enable controlled access to transcripts, so that they have defined and programmable lifetimes. We also discuss how this cooperation contributes to precursor processing and to the riboregulation of intricate post-transcriptional networks in the control of gene expression. The E. coli degradosome interacts with the cytoplasmic membrane, and we discuss how this interaction may spatially organise the assembly and contribute to subunit cooperation and substrate capture.

abstract = {Repetitive sequences are a conserved feature of many bacterial genomes. While first reported almost thirty years ago, and frequently exploited for genotyping purposes, little is known about their origin, maintenance, or processes affecting the dynamics of within-genome evolution. Here, beginning with analysis of the diversity and abundance of short oligonucleotide sequences in the genome of Pseudomonas fluorescens SBW25, we show that over-represented short sequences define three distinct groups (GI, GII, and GIII) of repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences. Patterns of REP distribution suggest that closely linked REP sequences form a functional replicative unit: REP doublets are over-represented, randomly distributed in extragenic space, and more highly conserved than singlets. In addition, doublets are organized as inverted repeats, which together with intervening spacer sequences are predicted to form hairpin structures in ssDNA or mRNA. We refer to these newly defined entities as REPINs (REP doublets forming hairpins) and identify short reads from population sequencing that reveal putative transposition intermediates. The proximal relationship between GI, GII, and GIII REPINs and specific REP-associated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs), combined with features of the putative transposition intermediate, suggests a mechanism for within-genome dissemination. Analysis of the distribution of REPs in a range of RAYT-containing bacterial genomes, including Escherichia coli K-12 and Nostoc punctiforme, show that REPINs are a widely distributed, but hitherto unrecognized, family of miniature non-autonomous mobile DNA.},

It is estimated that the Escherichia coli chromosome carries approximately 300-500 BIMEs, whose biological role is at present unknown. We have identified a family of BIMEs consisting of two converging REP sequences flanking a 35 bp conserved segment which carries a static DNA bend and a binding site for IHF, the integration host factor of E.coli. We estimate that the E.coli genome harbors approximately 100 copies of this module, which we name 'RIB' (reiterative ihf BIME). We have analyzed by gel retardation and by footprinting the in vitro interaction of IHF with individual RIBs, and shown that the protein binds strongly and specifically to their center. We have also demonstrated binding of IHF to the chromosomal population of RIBs, using a new approach which combines two-dimensional bandshift and Southern blotting. RIB elements are at the end of transcription units, and thus define a new class of ihf sites. Possible implications for genome structure and DNA topology are discussed.},

abstract = {The coordinated regulation of gene expression is required for homeostasis, growth and development in all organisms. Such coordination may be partly achieved at the level of messenger RNA stability, in which the targeted destruction of subsets of transcripts generates the potential for cross-regulating metabolic pathways. In Escherichia coli, the balance and composition of the transcript population is affected by RNase E, an essential endoribonuclease that not only turns over RNA but also processes certain key RNA precursors. RNase E cleaves RNA internally, but its catalytic power is determined by the 5' terminus of the substrate, even if this lies at a distance from the cutting site. Here we report crystal structures of the catalytic domain of RNase E as trapped allosteric intermediates with RNA substrates. Four subunits of RNase E catalytic domain associate into an interwoven quaternary structure, explaining why the subunit organization is required for catalytic activity. The subdomain encompassing the active site is structurally congruent to a deoxyribonuclease, making an unexpected link in the evolutionary history of RNA and DNA nucleases. The structure explains how the recognition of the 5' terminus of the substrate may trigger catalysis and also sheds light on the question of how RNase E might selectively process, rather than destroy, specific RNA precursors.},

abstract = {An Escherichia coli strain, ECOR28, was found to have insertions of an identical sequence (1,279 bp in length) at 10 loci in its genome. This insertion sequence (named IS621) has one large open reading frame encoding a putative protein that is 326 amino acids in length. A computer-aided homology search using the DNA sequence as the query revealed that IS621 was homologous to the piv genes, encoding pilin gene invertase (PIV). A homology search using the amino acid sequence of the putative protein encoded by IS621 as the query revealed that the protein also has partial homology to transposases encoded by the IS110/IS492 family elements, which were known to have partial homology to PIV. This indicates that IS621 belongs to the IS110/IS492 family but is most closely related to the piv genes. In fact, a phylogenetic tree constructed on the basis of amino acid sequences of PIV proteins and transposases revealed that IS621 belongs to the piv gene group, which is distinct from the IS110/IS492 family elements, which form several groups. PIV proteins and transposases encoded by the IS110/IS492 family elements, including IS621, have four acidic amino acid residues, which are conserved at positions in their N-terminal regions. These residues may constitute a tetrad D-E(or D)-D-D motif as the catalytic center. Interestingly, IS621 was inserted at specific sites within repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences at 10 loci in the ECOR28 genome. IS621 may not recognize the entire REP sequence in transposition, but it recognizes a 15-bp sequence conserved in the REP sequences around the target site. There are several elements belonging to the IS110/IS492 family that also transpose to specific sites in the repeated sequences, as does IS621. IS621 does not have terminal inverted repeats like most of the IS110/IS492 family elements. The terminal sequences of IS621 have homology with the 26-bp inverted repeat sequences of pilin gene inversion sites that are recognized and used for inversion of pilin genes by PIV. This suggests that IS621 initiates transposition through recognition of their terminal regions and cleavage at the ends by a mechanism similar to that used for PIV to promote inversion at the pilin gene inversion sites.},

abstract = {Escherichia coli endoribonuclease E has a major influence on gene expression. It is essential for the maturation of ribosomal and transfer RNA as well as the rapid degradation of messenger RNA. The latter ensures that translation closely follows programming at the level of transcription. Recently, one of the hallmarks of RNase E, i.e. its ability to bind via a 5'-monophosphorylated end, was shown to be unnecessary for the initial cleavage of some polycistronic tRNA precursors. Here we show using RNA-seq analyses of ribonuclease-deficient strains in vivo and a 5'-sensor mutant of RNase E in vitro that, contrary to current models, 5'-monophosphate-independent, 'direct entry' cleavage is a major pathway for degrading and processing RNA. Moreover, we present further evidence that direct entry is facilitated by RNase E binding simultaneously to multiple unpaired regions. These simple requirements may maximize the rate of degradation and processing by permitting multiple sites to be surveyed directly without being constrained by 5'-end tethering. Cleavage was detected at a multitude of sites previously undescribed for RNase E, including ones that regulate the activity and specificity of ribosomes. A potentially broad role for RNase G, an RNase E paralogue, in the trimming of 5'-monophosphorylated ends was also revealed.},

The expanding Next Generation Sequencing technologies now allow to locate change points at the nucleotide resolution.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Because of its complexity which is almost linear in the sequence length when the maximal number of segments is constant, and as its performance had been acknowledged for microarrays, we propose to use the Pruned Dynamic Programming algorithm for Seq-experiment outputs. This requires the adaptation of the algorithm to the negative binomial distribution with which we model the data. We show that if the dispersion in the signal is known, the PDP algorithm can be used, and we provide an estimator for this dispersion. We describe a compression framework which reduces the time complexity without modifying the accuracy of the segmentation. We propose to estimate the number of segments via a penalized likelihood criterion.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: REPs (Repetitive Extragenic Palindromes) are small (20-40 bp) palindromic repeats found in high copies in some prokaryotic genomes, hypothesized to play a role in DNA supercoiling, transcription termination, mRNA stabilization.

RESULTS: We have monitored a large number of REP elements in prokaryotic genomes, and found that most can be sorted into two large DNA super-families, as they feature at one end unpaired motifs fitting either the GTAG or the CGTC consensus. Tagged REPs have been identified in >80 species in 8 different phyla. GTAG and CGTC repeats reside predominantly in microorganisms of the gamma and alpha division of Proteobacteria, respectively. However, the identification of members of both super- families in deeper branching phyla such Cyanobacteria and Planctomycetes supports the notion that REPs are old components of the bacterial chromosome. On the basis of sequence content and overall structure, GTAG and CGTC repeats have been assigned to 24 and 4 families, respectively. Of these, some are species-specific, others reside in multiple species, and several organisms contain different REP types. In many families, most units are close to each other in opposite orientation, and may potentially fold into larger secondary structures. In different REP-rich genomes the repeats are predominantly located between unidirectionally and convergently transcribed ORFs. REPs are predominantly located downstream from coding regions, and many are plausibly transcribed and function as RNA elements. REPs located inside genes have been identified in several species. Many lie within replication and global genome repair genes. It has been hypothesized that GTAG REPs are miniature transposons mobilized by specific transposases known as RAYTs (REP associated tyrosine transposases). RAYT genes are flanked either by GTAG repeats or by long terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) unrelated to GTAG repeats. Moderately abundant families of TIRs have been identified in multiple species.

CONCLUSIONS: CGTC REPs apparently lack a dedicated transposase. Future work will clarify whether these elements may be mobilized by RAYTs or other transposases, and assess if de-novo formation of either GTAG or CGTC repeats type still occurs.},

However, as data continue to accumulate, there has been no clear consensus on the appropriate normalization method to be used or the impact of a chosen method on the downstream analysis. In this work, we focus on a comprehensive comparison of seven recently proposed normalization methods for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data, with an emphasis on the use of varied real and simulated datasets involving different species and experimental designs to represent data characteristics commonly observed in practice.

However, the volume and output of data produced by these technologies present challenges in analysis. Here, a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM) is implemented and tailored to handle multiple genomic profile, to better facilitate genome annotation by assisting in the detection of transcripts, regulatory regions, and copy number variation by holistic microarray or NGS. With support for various data distributions, instead of limiting itself to one specific application, the proposed hidden semi-Markov model is designed to allow modeling options to accommodate different types of genomic data and to serve as a general segmentation engine. By incorporating genomic positions into the sojourn distribution of HSMM, with optional prior learning using annotation or previous studies, the modeling output is more biologically sensible. The proposed model has been compared with several other state-of-the-art segmentation models through simulation benchmarking, which shows that our efficient implementation achieves comparable or better sensitivity and specificity in genomic segmentation.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli chromosome contains about 300 bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIMEs). These elements, located at the 3' end of genes, are composed of three types of alternating repetitive extragenic palindromes (REPs). Based on the type of REP they contain and on their ability to interact with the integration host factor (IHF), BIMEs are subdivided into two families: BIME-1 elements contain an IHF binding site flanked by converging Y and Z1 REPs, whereas BIME-2 elements contain a variable number of alternating Y and Z2 REPs without an IHF site. Although some BIMEs have been implicated in the protection of mRNA against 3' exonucleolytic degradation, the main role of elements belonging to both families remains to be elucidated. In this paper, we used oxolinic acid, a drug that reveals potential sites of DNA gyrase action, to demonstrate that DNA gyrase interacts in vivo with BIME-2 elements. The frequency of cleavage varied from one element to another, and the cleavage pattern observed in elements containing several REPs indicated that DNA gyrase cut DNA every two REPs. A single cleavage site has been identified in the Y REP in six out of seven instances, and the nucleotide sequence of a 44 bp fragment containing the scission point displayed conserved residues at six positions. The lack of one of the conserved residues accounted for the absence of cleavage in most of the Z2 REPs. Our results also showed that cleaved REPs were always associated with another REP, suggesting that a pair of diverging REPs constitutes the target of DNA gyrase. DNA gyrase cleavage at repetitive BIME-2 elements may have consequences for DNA topology and genomic rearrangements.},

abstract = {Transcription attenuation comprises several processes that affect transcript elongation and transcription termination, and has an important role in regulating gene expression. In most cases, transcription attenuation is used as a regulatory mechanism that allows the cell to adjust protein synthesis levels in response to a specific signal. Here, by using a tRNA gene as a transcriptional reporter, we characterize a new type of transcription attenuation mechanism in Escherichia coli that involves bacterial interspersed mosaic elements (BIMEs), the main family of repetitive extragenic elements. The transcription termination factor Rho is required for attenuation in association with BIMEs, thus revealing a new role for Rho as a BIMEs-dependent global regulator of gene expression. By mutational analyses, we identified nucleotide determinants of BIMEs that are required for attenuation and showed that this process relies on a sequence-specific mechanism. Our data are consistent with a model in which BIMEs provoke a pause in RNA polymerase movement and Rho acts ultimately to terminate transcription. BIME-dependent transcription attenuation may be used as a means to differentially regulate expression of adjacent genes belonging to a single operon. BIMEs are dispersed in more than 250 operons such that attenuation can simultaneously affect expression of a large number of genes encoding unrelated proteins. This attenuation phenomenon, together with the known ability of BIMEs to stabilize upstream mRNA, reveals how dispersion of these abundant repetitive elements may affect gene regulation at the genome level.},

abstract = {Microorganisms extensively reorganize gene expression to adjust growth rate to changes in growth conditions. At the genomic scale, we measured the contribution of both transcription and transcript stability to regulating messenger RNA (mRNA) concentration in Escherichia coli. Transcriptional control was the dominant regulatory process. Between growth rates of 0.10 and 0.63 h(-1), there was a generic increase in the bulk mRNA transcription. However, many transcripts became less stable and the median mRNA half-life decreased from 4.2 to 2.8 min. This is the first evidence that mRNA turnover is slower at extremely low-growth rates. The destabilization of many, but not all, transcripts at high-growth rate correlated with transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding the mRNA degradation machinery. We identified five classes of growth-rate regulation ranging from mainly transcriptional to mainly degradational. In general, differential stability within polycistronic messages encoded by operons does not appear to be affected by growth rate. We show here that the substantial reorganization of gene expression involving downregulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle genes and acetyl-CoA synthetase at high-growth rates is controlled mainly by transcript stability. Overall, our results demonstrate that the control of transcript stability has an important role in fine-tuning mRNA concentration during changes in growth rate.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inferring operon maps is crucial to understanding the regulatory networks of prokaryotic genomes. Recently, RNA-seq based transcriptome studies revealed that in many bacterial species the operon structure vary with the change of environmental conditions. Therefore, new computational solutions that use both static and dynamic data are necessary to create condition specific operon predictions.

RESULTS: In this work, we propose a novel classification method that integrates RNA-seq based transcriptome profiles with genomic sequence features to accurately identify the operons that are expressed under a measured condition. The classifiers are trained on a small set of confirmed operons and then used to classify the remaining gene pairs of the organism studied. Finally, by linking consecutive gene pairs classified as operons, our computational approach produces condition-dependent operon maps. We evaluated our approach on various RNA-seq expression profiles of the bacteria Haemophilus somni, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Our results demonstrate that, using features depending on both transcriptome dynamics and genome sequence characteristics, we can identify operon pairs with high accuracy. Moreover, the combination of DNA sequence and expression data results in more accurate predictions than each one alone.

CONCLUSION: We present a computational strategy for the comprehensive analysis of condition-dependent operon maps in prokaryotes. Our method can be used to generate condition specific operon maps of many bacterial organisms for which high-resolution transcriptome data is available.},

Seven such motifs were identified with the present list of PU regions. Remarkably, each PU cluster is exclusively composed of a mosaic combination of PU and of these other sequence motifs. We demonstrate directly by hybridization experiments that one of these motifs (called L) is indeed present at a large number of copies on the Escherichia coli chromosome and that its distribution follows the same species specificity as PU sequences themselves. We propose that the mosaic pattern of motif combination in PU clusters reveals a new type of bacterial genetic element which we propose to call BIME for Bacterial Interspersed Mosaic Element.

These sequences, called PU (palindromic units), are located outside structural genes. Conflicting results have been reported on the effects of different PU in transcription termination. Two PU located between co-transcribed genes in S. typhimurium were found not to cause transcription termination [25]. One PU located between convergently transcribed genes in E. coli behaved as bidirectional transcription terminators [12]. In the present paper, we show that three PU located between co-transcribed genes in E. coli are not a transcription terminator. From the literature, we define a subfamily of PU, which we called PU*, located between convergently transcribed genes which we implicate in bidirectional transcription termination. This plus the analysis of another PU which terminates transcription suggest that pecularities in the sequence or in the sequence environment of PU determine their role in transcription termination.

abstract = {The nucleotide sequences of the intercistronic regions from several multicistronic operons have recently been determined. In many cases such intercistronic regions consist of only a few base pairs (bp); in certain extreme cases, where the initiation codon of one gene overlaps the termination codon of the previous gene, intercistronic regions are essentially absent. However, in other cases intercistronic regions can be up to several hundred base pairs long; it seems reasonable to suppose that, at least in these cases, such regions have a role in regulation expression of the operon. Indeed, a regulatory function for the large intercistronic region of the rplJL-rpoBC operon has been demonstrated. We have now identified a genetic element, common to intercistronic regions from three independent bacterial operons (the histidine transport and the histidine biosynthetic operons of Salmonella typhimurium and the malK-lamB operon of the malB region of Escherichia coli), which we believe to be important in regulating the differential expression of individual genes in the multicistronic operons. A similar element is also found immediately following the trpR gene of E. coli although in this case it is not known whether or not a distal gene exists. Each of these elements consists of a long dyad symmetry which, once transcribed, could form an exceptionally stable stem-loop structure with a stem of up to 35 bp. In each case smaller palindromic units are also found, some of which overlap the main symmetry. The stem-loop structures show remarkable homology (...90\%) and probably have a common evolutionary origin, possibly an insertion element. It seems that the function of these structures is to effect a decrease in expression of the distal genes in an operon.},

abstract = {Repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences are highly conserved inverted repeats present in up to 1000 copies on the Escherichia coli chromosome. We have shown both in vivo and in vitro that REP sequences can stabilize upstream mRNA by blocking the processive action of 3' → 5' exonucleases. In a number of operons, mRNA stabilization by REP sequences plays an important role in the control of gene expression. Furthermore, differential mRNA stability mediated by the REP sequences can be responsible for differential gene expression within polycistronic operons. Despite the key role of REP sequences in mRNA stability and gene expression in a number of operons, several lines of evidence suggest that this is unlikely to be the primary reason for the exceptionally high degree of sequence conservation between REP sequences. Other possible functions for REP sequences are discussed. We propose that REP sequences may be a prokaryotic equivalent of ‘selfish DNA’ and that gene conversion may play a role in the evolution and maintenance of REP sequences.},

PHAST is best known as the engine behind the Conservation tracks in the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser. However, it also includes several other tools for phylogenetic modeling and functional element identification, as well as utilities for manipulating alignments, trees and genomic annotations. PHAST has been in development since 2002 and has now been downloaded more than 1000 times, but so far it has been released only as provisional ('beta') software. Here, we describe the first official release (v1.0) of PHAST, with improved stability, portability and documentation and several new features. We outline the components of the package and detail recent improvements. In addition, we introduce a new interface to the PHAST libraries from the R statistical computing environment, called RPHAST, and illustrate its use in a series of vignettes. We demonstrate that RPHAST can be particularly useful in applications involving both large-scale phylogenomics and complex statistical analyses. The R interface also makes the PHAST libraries acccessible to non-C programmers, and is useful for rapid prototyping. PHAST v1.0 and RPHAST v1.0 are available for download at http://compgen.bscb.cornell.edu/phast, under the terms of an unrestrictive BSD-style license. RPHAST can also be obtained from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN; http://cran.r-project.org).},

The stabilization of a protected cistron can be an important determinant in the level of gene expression. Our results suggest that RNase E, an endoribonuclease, initiates the degradation of REP-stabilized mRNA. However, subsequent degradation of mRNA fragments containing a REP-stabilizer poses a special challenge to the mRNA degradation machinery. Two enzymes, the DEAD-box RNA helicase, RhlB and poly(A) polymerase (PAP) are required to facilitate the degradation of REP-stabilizers by polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase). This is the first in vivo evidence that these enzymes are required for the degradation of REP-stabilizers. Furthermore, our results show that REP degradation by RhlB and PNPase requires their association with RNase E as components of the RNA degradosome, thus providing the first in vivo evidence that this ribonucleolytic multienzyme complex is involved in the degradation of structured mRNA fragments.},

abstract = {Recent advances in prokaryote genetics have highlighted the important and complex roles of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs). Although blocking mRNA translation is often the main function of sRNAs, these molecules can also induce the degradation of target mRNAs using a mechanism that drastically differs from eukaryotic RNA interference (RNAi). Whereas RNAi relies on RNase III-like machinery that is specific to double-strand RNAs, sRNA-mediated mRNA degradation in Escherichia coli and Samonella typhimurium depends on RNase E, a single-strand specific endoribonuclease. Surprisingly, the latest descriptions of sRNA-mediated mRNA degradation in various bacteria suggest a variety of previously unsuspected mechanisms. In this review, we focus on recently characterized mechanisms in which sRNAs can bind to target mRNAs to induce decay. These new mechanisms illustrate how sRNAs and mRNA structures, including riboswitches, act cooperatively with protein partners to initiate the decay of mRNAs.

abstract = {A new algorithm called RNAMotif containing RNA structure and sequence constraints and a thermodynamic scoring system was used to search for intrinsic rho-independent terminators in the Escherichia coli K-12 genome. We identified all 135 reported terminators and 940 putative terminator sequences beginning no more than 60 nt away from the 3'-end of the annotated transcription units (TU). Putative and reported terminators with the scores above our chosen threshold were found for 37 of the 53 non-coding RNA TU and for almost 50\% of the 2592 annotated protein-encoding TU, which correlates well with the number of TU expected to contain rho-independent terminators. We also identified 439 terminators that could function in a bi-directional fashion, servicing one gene on the positive strand and a different gene on the negative strand. Approximately 700 additional termination signals in non-coding regions (NCR) far away from the nearest annotated gene were predicted. This number correlates well with the excess number of predicted 'orphan' promoters in the NCR, and these promoters and terminators may be associated with as yet unidentified TU. The significant number of high scoring hits that occurred within the reading frame of annotated genes suggests that either an additional component of rho-independent terminators exists or that a suppressive mechanism to prevent unwanted termination remains to be discovered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although prokaryotic gene transcription has been studied over decades, many aspects of the process remain poorly understood. Particularly, recent studies have revealed that transcriptomes in many prokaryotes are far more complex than previously thought. Genes in an operon are often alternatively and dynamically transcribed under different conditions, and a large portion of genes and intergenic regions have antisense RNA (asRNA) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA) transcripts, respectively. Ironically, similar studies have not been conducted in the model bacterium E coli K12, thus it is unknown whether or not the bacterium possesses similar complex transcriptomes. Furthermore, although RNA-seq becomes the major method for analyzing the complexity of prokaryotic transcriptome, it is still a challenging task to accurately assemble full length transcripts using short RNA-seq reads.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: To fill these gaps, we have profiled the transcriptomes of E. coli K12 under different culture conditions and growth phases using a highly specific directional RNA-seq technique that can capture various types of transcripts in the bacterial cells, combined with a highly accurate and robust algorithm and tool TruHMM (http://bioinfolab.uncc.edu/TruHmm\_package/) for assembling full length transcripts. We found that 46.9 \~{} 63.4\% of expressed operons were utilized in their putative alternative forms, 72.23 \~{} 89.54\% genes had putative asRNA transcripts and 51.37 \~{} 72.74\% intergenic regions had putative ncRNA transcripts under different culture conditions and growth phases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: As has been demonstrated in many other prokaryotes, E. coli K12 also has a highly complex and dynamic transcriptomes under different culture conditions and growth phases. Such complex and dynamic transcriptomes might play important roles in the physiology of the bacterium. TruHMM is a highly accurate and robust algorithm for assembling full-length transcripts in prokaryotes using directional RNA-seq short reads.},

abstract = {Repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP) sequences are highly structured elements found downstream of ∼500 genes in Escherichia coli that result in extensive stem-loop structures in their mRNAs. However, their physiological role has remained elusive. Here, we show that REP sequences can downregulate translation, but only if they are within 15 nt of a termination codon; a spacing of 16 nt has no effect, suggesting that the REP element acts to stall ribosome movement. Ribosome stalling leads to cleavage of the mRNA and induction of the trans-translation process. Using nrdAB as a model, we find that its regulation can be partially reversed by overexpression of RNA helicases and can be fully overcome upon UV stress, emphasizing the importance of this regulatory process. Since 50\% of REP-associated genes have these elements within the critical 15 nt, these findings identify a regulatory mechanism with the potential to affect translation from a large number of genes.},

Here, we present new algorithms, specific to bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of RNA-seq data. The algorithms are implemented in an open source software system called Rockhopper that supports various stages of bacterial RNA-seq data analysis, including aligning sequencing reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing results. We demonstrate the performance of Rockhopper using 2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 RNA-seq experiments conducted with Escherichia coli, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Salmonella enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes and Xenorhabdus nematophila. We find that the transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system's ability to identify novel small RNAs, operons and transcription start sites. Our results suggest that Rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial RNA-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.},

abstract = {Extragenic sequences in genomes, such as microRNA and CRISPR, are vital players in the cell. Repetitive extragenic palindromic sequences (REPs) are a class of extragenic sequences, which form nucleotide stem-loop structures. REPs are found in many bacterial species at a high copy number and are important in regulation of certain bacterial functions, such as Integration Host Factor recruitment and mRNA turnover. Although a new clade of putative transposases (RAYTs or TnpA(REP)) is often associated with an increase in these repeats, it is not clear how these proteins might have directed amplification of REPs. We report here the structure to 2.6 \AA of TnpA(REP) from Escherichia coli MG1655 bound to a REP. Sequence analysis showed that TnpA(REP) is highly related to the IS200/IS605 family, but in contrast to IS200/IS605 transposases, TnpA(REP) is a monomer, is auto-inhibited and is active only in manganese. These features suggest that, relative to IS200/IS605 transposases, it has evolved a different mechanism for the movement of discrete segments of DNA and has been severely down-regulated, perhaps to prevent REPs from sweeping through genomes.},

This provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. We report reference measurements composed of 41-52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90\% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

abstract = {We identified the sequence-specific starting positions of consecutive miscalls in the mapping of reads obtained from the Illumina Genome Analyser (GA). Detailed analysis of the miscall pattern indicated that the underlying mechanism involves sequence-specific interference of the base elongation process during sequencing. The two major sequence patterns that trigger this sequence-specific error (SSE) are: (i) inverted repeats and (ii) GGC sequences. We speculate that these sequences favor dephasing by inhibiting single-base elongation, by: (i) folding single-stranded DNA and (ii) altering enzyme preference. This phenomenon is a major cause of sequence coverage variability and of the unfavorable bias observed for population-targeted methods such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Moreover, SSE is a potential cause of false single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls and also significantly hinders de novo assembly. This article highlights the importance of recognizing SSE and its underlying mechanisms in the hope of enhancing the potential usefulness of the Illumina sequencers.},

abstract = {The REP sequence is a highly conserved inverted repeat that is present in about 25\% of all E. coli transcription units. We show that the REP sequence can stabilize upstream RNA, independently of any other sequences, by protection from 3'-5' exonuclease attack. The REP sequence is frequently responsible for the differential stability of different segments of mRNA within an operon. We demonstrate that REP-stabilized mRNA can be translated in vivo and that cloning the REP sequence downstream of a gene can increase protein synthesis. This provides direct evidence that alterations in mRNA stability can play a role in determining bacterial gene expression. The implications of these findings for the mechanisms of mRNA degradation and for the role of RNA stability in the regulation of gene expression are discussed.},

@article{Pobre2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The RNA steady-state levels in the cell are a balance between synthesis and degradation rates. Although transcription is important, RNA processing and turnover are also key factors in the regulation of gene expression. In Escherichia coli there are three main exoribonucleases (RNase II, RNase R and PNPase) involved in RNA degradation. Although there are many studies about these exoribonucleases not much is known about their global effect in the transcriptome.

RESULTS: In order to study the effects of the exoribonucleases on the transcriptome, we sequenced the total RNA (RNA-Seq) from wild-type cells and from mutants for each of the exoribonucleases (∆rnb, ∆rnr and ∆pnp). We compared each of the mutant transcriptome with the wild-type to determine the global effects of the deletion of each exoribonucleases in exponential phase. We determined that the deletion of RNase II significantly affected 187 transcripts, while deletion of RNase R affects 202 transcripts and deletion of PNPase affected 226 transcripts. Surprisingly, many of the transcripts are actually down-regulated in the exoribonuclease mutants when compared to the wild-type control. The results obtained from the transcriptomic analysis pointed to the fact that these enzymes were changing the expression of genes related with flagellum assembly, motility and biofilm formation. The three exoribonucleases affected some stable RNAs, but PNPase was the main exoribonuclease affecting this class of RNAs. We confirmed by qPCR some fold-change values obtained from the RNA-Seq data, we also observed that all the exoribonuclease mutants were significantly less motile than the wild-type cells. Additionally, RNase II and RNase R mutants were shown to produce more biofilm than the wild-type control while the PNPase mutant did not form biofilms.

CONCLUSIONS: In this work we demonstrate how deep sequencing can be used to discover new and relevant functions of the exoribonucleases. We were able to obtain valuable information about the transcripts affected by each of the exoribonucleases and compare the roles of the three enzymes. Our results show that the three exoribonucleases affect cell motility and biofilm formation that are two very important factors for cell survival, especially for pathogenic cells.},

abstract = {Multiple change-point detection models assume that the observed data is a realization of an independent random process affected by K-1 abrupt changes, called change-points, at some unknown positions. For off-line detection a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm retrieves the K-1 change-points minimizing the quadratic loss and reduces the complexity from $\backslash$Theta(n\^{}K) to $\backslash$Theta(Kn\^{}2) where n is the number of observations. The quadratic complexity in n still restricts the use of such an algorithm to small or intermediate values of n. We propose a pruned DP algorithm that recovers the optimal solution. We demonstrate that at worst the complexity is in O(Kn\^{}2) time and O(Kn) space and is therefore at worst equivalent to the classical DP algorithm. We show empirically that the run-time of our proposed algorithm is drastically reduced compared to the classical DP algorithm. More precisely, our algorithm is able to process a million points in a matter of minutes compared to several days with the classical DP algorithm. Moreover, the principle of the proposed algorithm can be extended to other convex losses (for example the Poisson loss) and as the algorithm process one observation after the other it could be adapted for on-line problems.},

Here, we describe the use of such an array, constructed at the level of 20 nt resolution for the Escherichia coli MG1655 genome, to observe genome-wide changes in the steady-state RNA levels in mutants defective in either RNase E or RNase III. The array data were validated by comparison to previously published results for a variety of specific transcripts as well as independent northern analysis of additional mRNAs and sRNAs. In the absence of RNase E, 60\% of the annotated coding sequences showed either increases or decreases in their steady-state levels. In contrast, only 12\% of the coding sequences were affected in the absence of RNase III. Unexpectedly, many coding sequences showed decreased abundance in the RNase E mutant, while more than half of the annotated sRNAs showed changes in abundance. Furthermore, the steady-state levels of many transcripts showed overlapping effects of both ribonucleases. Data are also presented demonstrating how the arrays were used to identify potential new genes, RNase III cleavage sites and the direct or indirect control of specific biological pathways.},

abstract = {The high-affinity histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium is encoded by a four-gene operon containing a large intercistronic region located between the first gene (hisJ) and the three distal genes (hisQ, hisM, hisP). The level of expression of hisJ is 30-fold greater than that of hisP. In order to investigate the role of the intercistronic region in intra-operonic control of gene expression, we have isolated MudII-mediated lacZ gene fusions to hisQ, hisM and hisP. We have used these fusions to isolate and analyse mutants that have altered levels of expression of the hisQ gene, the first gene downstream from the intercistronic region. The results indicate that intra-operonic regulation is due to a combination of factors including efficiency of translational initiation, mRNA degradation, and retroregulation of hisJ expression. They also suggest that the REP (Repetitive Extragenic Palindromic) sequences, which are located in the hisJ-hisQ intercistronic region, may interfere with translation of the hisQ gene and affect upstream messenger RNA stability by protecting it from 3' to 5' nuclease degradation (in agreement with data presented by Newbury et al., 1987).},

abstract = {Repetitive extragenic palindromic (REPs) sequences were first described in enterobacteriacea and later in Pseudomonas putida. We have detected a new variant (51 base pairs) of REP sequences that appears to be disseminated in more than 300 copies in the Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 genome. The finding of REP sequences in P. syringae confirms the broad presence of this type of repetitive sequence in bacteria. We analyzed the distribution of REP sequences and the structure of the clusters, and we show that palindromy is conserved. REP sequences appear to be allocated to the extragenic space, with a special preference for the intergenic spaces limited by convergent genes, while their presence is scarce between divergent genes. Using REP sequences as markers of extragenicity we re-annotated a set of genes of the P. syringae DC3000 genome demonstrating that REP sequences can be used for refinement of annotation of a genome. The similarity detected between virulence genes from evolutionarily distant pathogenic bacteria suggests the acquisition of clusters of virulence genes by horizontal gene transfer. We did not detect the presence of P. syringae REP elements in the principal pathogenicity gene clusters. This absence suggests that genome fragments lacking REP sequences could point to regions recently acquired from other organisms, and REP sequences might be new tracers for gaining insight into key aspects of bacterial genome evolution, especially when studying pathogenicity acquisition. In addition, as the P. syringae REP sequence is species-specific with respect to the sequenced genomes, it is an exceptional candidate for use as a fingerprint in precise genotyping and epidemiological studies.},

abstract = {REPs are highly repeated intergenic palindromic sequences often clustered into structures called BIMEs including two individual REPs separated by short linker of variable length. They play a variety of key roles in the cell. REPs also resemble the sub-terminal hairpins of the atypical IS200/605 family of insertion sequences which encode Y1 transposases (TnpA(IS200/IS605)). These belong to the HUH endonuclease family, carry a single catalytic tyrosine (Y) and promote single strand transposition. Recently, a new clade of Y1 transposases (TnpA(REP)) was found associated with REP/BIME in structures called REPtrons. It has been suggested that TnpA(REP) is responsible for REP/BIME proliferation over genomes. We analysed and compared REP distribution and REPtron structure in numerous available E. coli and Shigella strains. Phylogenetic analysis clearly indicated that tnpA(REP) was acquired early in the species radiation and was lost later in some strains. To understand REP/BIME behaviour within the host genome, we also studied E. coli K12 TnpA(REP) activity in vitro and demonstrated that it catalyses cleavage and recombination of BIMEs. While TnpA(REP) shared the same general organization and similar catalytic characteristics with TnpA(IS200/IS605) transposases, it exhibited distinct properties potentially important in the creation of BIME variability and in their amplification. TnpA(REP) may therefore be one of the first examples of transposase domestication in prokaryotes.},
